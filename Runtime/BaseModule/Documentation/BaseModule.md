# Base Module

The Base Module is the part of FlowIoC every other module is built on: the **Root**
that puts a module in the scene, the **Context** that declares its bindings, the
**injection** that wires objects together, and the **signals** that let modules talk
without knowing about each other.

This document is about using those pieces. Commands have their own document —
see [Commands](../Controller/Documentation/Controller.md).

## The Shape of a Module

A FlowIoC module is a folder of ordinary C# classes plus two small ones that make it
a module:

```csharp
// The scene presence. Almost always empty.
public class PlayerRoot : Root<PlayerContext> { }
```

```csharp
// The wiring. Declarations only, no logic.
public class PlayerContext : Context
{
    private PlayerSignals _signals;

    public override void SignalBindings()
    {
        base.SignalBindings();
        _signals = InjectionBinderCrossContext.Bind<PlayerSignals>();
    }

    public override void InjectionBindings()
    {
        base.InjectionBindings();
        InjectionBinderCrossContext.Bind<IPlayerModel, PlayerModel>();
    }

    public override void MediationBindings()
    {
        base.MediationBindings();
        MediationBinder.Bind<PlayerHudView>().To<PlayerHudMediator>();
    }

    public override void CommandBindings()
    {
        base.CommandBindings();
        CommandBinder.Bind(_signals.Incoming.AddCurrency).ToSequence<AddCurrencyCommand>();
    }

    public override void Launch()
    {
        base.Launch();
        _signals.Incoming.InitializePlayer.Dispatch();
    }
}
```

Everything else in the module — models, commands, functions, views, services — is
reached through one of those four `Bind` calls.

---

## Root

A Root is a `MonoBehaviour`. Drop it on a GameObject and the module exists; delete
the GameObject and the module is gone.

```csharp
public class MatchRoot : Root<MatchContext> { }
```

Every Root is destroyed with its scene, and every instance gets its own Context. A
module that has to outlive a scene load — audio, analytics, player profile — says so
on its own Root:

```csharp
[PersistentRoot]
public class AudioRoot : Root<AudioContext> { }
```

The framework detaches the Root and marks it do not destroy before the Context is
built. A second Root of the same type — the copy a reloaded scene brings back — stands
down: it builds no Context, binds nothing, and is destroyed with everything under it,
so the Root from the first load keeps its Context and its state.

The inspector exposes the switches that matter:

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `initializeOrder` | Orders this Root against the other Roots in the scene. Lower runs first. |
| `AutoInitialize` | Off: the Context is created but never started. Call `StartContext(true)` yourself. |
| `AutoBindInjections` / `AutoBindMediations` | Off: skip that binding phase. Useful when a test provides its own doubles. |
| `AutoSetup` / `AutoLaunch` | Off: `Setup()` / `Launch()` do not run. Call `Setup(true)` / `Launch(true)` from a test. |
| `IsTest` | Marks the context as a test context. Sub-contexts carry their own flag. |

A Root should stay empty. If you find yourself adding fields to one, the state
belongs in a Model and the behaviour in a Command. The four `protected virtual`
hooks — `BeforeCreateContext`, `AfterCreateBeforeStartContext`,
`AfterBindingsBeforeInjections`, `AfterStartBeforeLaunchContext` — exist for
framework-level extensions, not for game logic.

---

## Context

A Context has five methods you override, and each has one job.

| Method | Bind here | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `SignalBindings()` | signal holders | first |
| `InjectionBindings()` | models, services | second |
| `MediationBindings()` | view → mediator pairs | third |
| `CommandBindings()` | signal → command chains | fourth |
| `Setup()` | cross-module wiring | after **every** Root has finished binding |
| `Launch()` | the first dispatch | after every Root has finished `Setup()` |

Always call `base.<Method>()` first — the base implementations are empty today, but
skipping them is how a future framework change silently breaks your module.

The order is not arbitrary: `CommandBindings()` needs the signal fields that
`SignalBindings()` assigned, so a signal must be bound before it can be bound *to*.

Four binders are available on every Context:

| Binder | Scope |
|---|---|
| `InjectionBinder` | this Context only |
| `InjectionBinderCrossContext` | every Context in the application |
| `MediationBinder` | this Context only |
| `CommandBinder` | this Context only |

---

## The Lifecycle

```
Root.Awake()
  └─ creates the Context, initializes sub-contexts, registers with RootsManager

Root.Start()  →  RootsManager.StartContexts()
  └─ for each Root, ordered by initializeOrder:
       Context.Start()  →  CoreBindings()
       SignalBindings() → InjectionBindings() → MediationBindings() → CommandBindings()
       InjectAllInstances()
       ExecutePostConstructMethods()

  ──────── end of frame ────────

  Setup()  on every Root
  Launch() on every Root
```

Two properties of this order are worth internalising, because most cross-module bugs
come from ignoring them:

1. **Bindings of one Root are complete before injection runs for that Root.** So a
   model can inject another model bound in the same Context, even if it was bound
   later in the file.
2. **`Setup()` does not start until every Root in the scene has finished binding.**
   That is what makes Connectors possible: at `Setup()` time, every module's signals
   exist, whatever order the Roots happen to sit in the hierarchy.

`Launch()` is the same barrier one step later, which is why it is the right place to
dispatch the signal that starts the game.

---

## Injection

### Binding

```csharp
// Concrete type — the binder creates it and hands it back.
_playerModel = InjectionBinder.Bind<PlayerModel>();

// Interface to implementation — this is the usual form.
InjectionBinder.Bind<IPlayerModel, PlayerModel>();

// An object you already have.
InjectionBinder.BindInstance<IClock>(new ServerClock());

// A MonoBehaviour, added to the Context's GameObject.
InjectionBinderCrossContext.BindMonoBehaviorInstance<IInputProvider, InputProvider>();

// Named, when one interface has several implementations.
InjectionBinder.Bind<IStorage, LocalStorage>("local");
InjectionBinder.Bind<IStorage, RemoteStorage>("remote");
```

### Consuming

```csharp
[Inject]          private IPlayerModel  _playerModel { get; set; }
[Inject("remote")] private IStorage     _storage     { get; set; }
[InjectSignal]    private PlayerSignals _signals     { get; set; }
```

> **Properties, not fields.** `[Inject]`, `[InjectSignal]` and `[SignalParam]` are
> declared `AttributeTargets.Property`. A field carrying one of them compiles and is
> then skipped, leaving a null at runtime.

Imperative lookup is available where an attribute will not do:

```csharp
var model = InjectionBinder.GetInstance<IPlayerModel>();
var storage = InjectionBinder.GetInstance<IStorage>("remote");
```

### Choosing the scope

`InjectionBinderCrossContext` is one shared container for the whole application.
Bind there when another module has to see the object; bind to `InjectionBinder`
when it must not. Signal holders that appear in a Connector are always cross-context;
a `…SignalsInternal` holder never is.

### Reaching the Context's GameObject

`CoreBindings()` binds the Context's own GameObject under the Context type's name, so
a model that needs to parent something into the module can ask for it:

```csharp
public class CameraModel : ICameraModel
{
    [Inject(nameof(CameraContext))] private GameObject _root { get; set; }
}
```

### Running code after injection — `IConstructable`

A model often cannot finish initialising in its constructor, because its injected
dependencies are not there yet. Implement `IConstructable` and the framework calls
`PostConstruct()` once, after every injection for the context is complete.

```csharp
public class CameraModel : ICameraModel, IConstructable
{
    [Inject] private ICameraConfigProvider _configProvider { get; set; }

    public bool IsPostConstructed { get; set; }
    public bool IsDeconstructed   { get; set; }

    public void PostConstruct()
    {
        // _configProvider is guaranteed to be here.
        _blendSettings = _configProvider.LoadBlendSettings();
    }

    public void Deconstruct()
    {
        _blendSettings = null;
    }
}
```

`Deconstruct()` runs when the binding is removed. There is no `[PostConstruct]`
attribute — the interface is the mechanism.

---

## Signals

A signal is a typed event. It is the only thing a module exposes.

```csharp
public class PlayerSignals : ISignalHolder
{
    public PlayerSignalsIncoming Incoming = new();
    public PlayerSignalsOutgoing Outgoing = new();
}

public class PlayerSignalsIncoming
{
    public Signal InitializePlayer = new();
    public Signal<double> AddCurrency = new();
}

public class PlayerSignalsOutgoing
{
    public Signal<double> CurrencyChanged = new();
}
```

Five arities exist: `Signal` through `Signal<T1, T2, T3, T4>`.

```csharp
_signals.Incoming.AddCurrency.Dispatch(100d);

_signals.Outgoing.CurrencyChanged.AddListener(OnCurrencyChanged);
_signals.Outgoing.CurrencyChanged.AddListenerOnce(OnFirstChangeOnly);
_signals.Outgoing.CurrencyChanged.RemoveListener(OnCurrencyChanged);
_signals.Outgoing.CurrencyChanged.RemoveAllListeners();
```

`Dispatch` runs three things, always in this order: the once-listeners, then the commands
bound to the signal, then the ordinary listeners. So a listener added with `AddListenerOnce`
sees the dispatch before the command that acts on it has run, and a listener added with
`AddListener` sees it after — which is what makes `AddListener` the one a Mediator uses to
redraw from a value a command has just written.

`RemoveAllListeners` drops both listener lists at once and leaves the bound commands alone,
because what a signal runs in the middle belongs to the context that bound it. A Mediator's
`OnRemove` is otherwise the only teardown path there is, so a signal that outlives the
objects listening to it keeps every listener a destroyed one left behind.

### The Incoming / Outgoing convention

The framework does not require the split — `ISignalHolder` is an empty marker
interface. The convention is what makes a Connector readable, because every line in
one reads the same way:

```csharp
_shopSignals.Outgoing.PurchaseRequested.Connect(_playerSignals.Incoming.SpendCurrency);
```

Read it as: *this module announces X, that module accepts X*. Signals that must never
leave the module go in a separate `…SignalsInternal` holder bound with the plain
`InjectionBinder`, so no Connector can reach them.

### Connecting modules

Connections are made in `Setup()`, never in a binding phase — the other module's
signals may not exist yet.

```csharp
public class ShopConnectorSubContext : Context
{
    private const string Group = nameof(ShopConnectorSubContext);

    private ShopSignals   _shopSignals;
    private PlayerSignals _playerSignals;

    public override void Setup()
    {
        _shopSignals   = InjectionBinderCrossContext.GetInstance<ShopSignals>();
        _playerSignals = InjectionBinderCrossContext.GetInstance<PlayerSignals>();

        _shopSignals.Outgoing.PurchaseRequested
            .Connect(_playerSignals.Incoming.SpendCurrency, Group);
    }
}
```

`Connect` also takes a delegate, and can adapt between differently-shaped signals
through a converter:

```csharp
_matchSignals.Outgoing.MatchEnded
    .Connect(_analyticsSignals.Incoming.LogEvent, summary => summary.ToAnalyticsEvent());
```

`SignalConnector.DisconnectGroup(Group)` removes every connection made with that
group id. `DisconnectAll()` clears everything and runs automatically on subsystem
registration, so connections never survive into the next play session.

---

## Views and Mediators

A View is a `MonoBehaviour` that holds scene references and raises callbacks. A
Mediator is a plain injected class that drives it.

```csharp
[RequireComponent(typeof(ViewInjector))]
public class PlayerHudView : MonoBehaviour, IView
{
    public bool IsRegistered { get; set; }

    public Text CurrencyLabel;
    public Action SpendClicked;
}
```

```csharp
public class PlayerHudMediator : IMediator
{
    [Inject]       private PlayerHudView _view    { get; set; }
    [InjectSignal] private PlayerSignals _signals { get; set; }

    public void OnRegister()
    {
        _signals.Outgoing.CurrencyChanged.AddListener(Render);
        _view.SpendClicked += OnSpendClicked;
    }

    public void OnRemove()
    {
        _signals.Outgoing.CurrencyChanged.RemoveListener(Render);
        _view.SpendClicked -= OnSpendClicked;
    }

    private void Render(double amount) => _view.CurrencyLabel.text = $"{amount:N0}";
    private void OnSpendClicked() => _signals.Incoming.SpendCurrency.Dispatch();
}
```

```csharp
MediationBinder.Bind<PlayerHudView>().To<PlayerHudMediator>();
```

The `ViewInjector` component on the GameObject lists every `IView` on it and resolves
which Context each belongs to — by bubbling up the hierarchy, by an explicit Root
reference, or by Root name. Registration happens as soon as that Context is started,
and `OnRemove` runs when the object is destroyed. A view the list does not name - on an
object assembled from code - registers with the defaults, bubbling up and Auto Register.

Turn off **Auto Register** for a view in the ViewInjector list to control it yourself:

```csharp
using FlowIoC.BaseModule.ViewsMediators.Utils;

_view.Register();
_view.UnRegister();
```

Whatever you subscribe in `OnRegister`, unsubscribe in `OnRemove`. Mediators are
pooled and reused; a listener left behind is a leak that fires against a destroyed
view.

---

## Sub-Contexts

A sub-context is a full Context that runs inside another Root. It goes through the
same four binding phases immediately after its parent, and gets its own `Setup()` and
`Launch()`.

Attach one from the Root's inspector (*Add Sub Context*), which lists every `Context`
type in the project. Each entry carries its own `AutoSetup` and `IsTest` flags.

Use a sub-context when a feature is big enough to deserve its own bindings file but
does not need its own GameObject in the scene:

```
ShopModule/
├── Scripts/Runtime/RootsContexts/
│   ├── ShopRoot.cs
│   └── ShopContext.cs
└── zSubModules/
    └── DailyDealModule/Scripts/Runtime/RootsContexts/
        └── DailyDealSubContext.cs      ← attached to ShopRoot
```

Mark a Context with `[ExcludeFromContextWindow]` to keep it out of the picker.

---

## Providers

Two services are bound by `CoreBindings()` and are always injectable, with no
registration on your part:

```csharp
[Inject] private ICoroutineProvider _coroutineProvider { get; set; }
[Inject] private IUpdateProvider    _updateProvider    { get; set; }
```

`ICoroutineProvider` gives a non-`MonoBehaviour` class a place to run coroutines:

```csharp
_coroutineProvider.StartCoroutine(LoadRoutine());
_coroutineProvider.WaitForSeconds(2f, OnTimeout);
_coroutineProvider.WaitForEndOfFrame(OnFrameEnd);
_coroutineProvider.WaitUntil(() => _model.IsReady, OnReady);
```

`IUpdateProvider` gives it the Unity update loops:

```csharp
_updateProvider.AddUpdate(Tick);
_updateProvider.AddLateUpdate(LateTick);
_updateProvider.AddFixedUpdate(PhysicsTick);

_updateProvider.RemoveUpdate(Tick);   // always pair these
```

---

## Tearing Down

Destroying the Root's GameObject destroys the Context: mediations, commands and
injections are unbound, `Deconstruct()` runs on every `IConstructable`, and everything
the Context bound into `InjectionBinderCrossContext` - its signal holder, its Service - is
taken out again. A module's public surface therefore lives exactly as long as its Root: a
scene's module goes with the scene and is bound fresh when the scene comes back, and a
persistent Root's Service lives for the run because that Root is never torn down. What was
handed in with `BindInstance`, the two providers say, belongs to the run and stays.

The holder goes last, after the Context's own binder, so a `Deconstruct()` that dispatches
still has a holder to dispatch through.

`OnApplicationPause` routes to `Context.PauseContext()` and `ResumeContext()`, both
`virtual` and empty by default. Override them for anything that must stop when the
app goes to the background:

```csharp
public override void PauseContext()
{
    base.PauseContext();
    _signals.Incoming.SaveNow.Dispatch();
}
```

Individual bindings can be removed while the context lives:

```csharp
InjectionBinder.UnBind<ITemporaryService>();
InjectionBinder.UnBind<IStorage>("remote");
```

---

## Scenarios

### A Context declares; it does not decide

```csharp
// ✅ Every line is a binding. You can read the module's whole surface in one screen.
public override void CommandBindings()
{
    base.CommandBindings();

    CommandBinder.Bind(_signals.Incoming.StartMatch)
        .ToSequence<ValidateMatchCommand>()
        .ToSequence<BuildMatchCommand>();
}
```

```csharp
// ❌ A decision hidden in the wiring. Nothing logs it, no test can reach it, and the
//    two branches drift apart over time.
public override void CommandBindings()
{
    base.CommandBindings();

    if (_saveModel.IsFirstRun)
        CommandBinder.Bind(_signals.Incoming.StartMatch).ToSequence<TutorialMatchCommand>();
    else
        CommandBinder.Bind(_signals.Incoming.StartMatch).ToSequence<BuildMatchCommand>();
}
```

Bind one chain and let a command choose, so the decision appears in the console.

### Cross-context only for what is genuinely public

```csharp
// ✅ The public signal holder is shared; the internal one is not.
public override void SignalBindings()
{
    base.SignalBindings();

    _signals  = InjectionBinderCrossContext.Bind<MatchSignals>();
    _internal = InjectionBinder.Bind<MatchSignalsInternal>();
}
```

```csharp
// ❌ Everything cross-context. Any module can now dispatch this module's internal
//    steps, and nothing tells you who really depends on whom any more.
_signals  = InjectionBinderCrossContext.Bind<MatchSignals>();
_internal = InjectionBinderCrossContext.Bind<MatchSignalsInternal>();
```

### Wire modules in `Setup()`, not in a binding phase

```csharp
// ✅ At Setup() time every module has finished binding, whatever the Root order is - so the
//    Connector gets the holders that are there instead of binding ones of its own.
public override void Setup()
{
    _shopSignals   = InjectionBinderCrossContext.GetInstance<ShopSignals>();
    _playerSignals = InjectionBinderCrossContext.GetInstance<PlayerSignals>();

    _shopSignals.Outgoing.PurchaseRequested.Connect(_playerSignals.Incoming.SpendCurrency);
}
```

```csharp
// ❌ Works only while ShopRoot happens to initialize after PlayerRoot. Reordering the
//    hierarchy, or loading the shop from a different scene, breaks it silently.
public override void SignalBindings()
{
    base.SignalBindings();

    _shopSignals.Outgoing.PurchaseRequested.Connect(_playerSignals.Incoming.SpendCurrency);
}
```

### Initialise in `PostConstruct()`, not in the constructor

```csharp
// ✅ Injections are guaranteed to be present.
public class MatchModel : IMatchModel, IConstructable
{
    [Inject] private IRulesProvider _rules { get; set; }

    public bool IsPostConstructed { get; set; }
    public bool IsDeconstructed   { get; set; }

    public void PostConstruct() => _turnLimit = _rules.TurnLimit;
}
```

```csharp
// ❌ _rules is still null here — the binder injects after construction.
public class MatchModel : IMatchModel
{
    [Inject] private IRulesProvider _rules { get; set; }

    public MatchModel() => _turnLimit = _rules.TurnLimit;   // NullReferenceException
}
```

### One Root per module, and let `initializeOrder` do the ordering

```csharp
// ✅ Independent Roots, one module each.
public class AudioRoot : Root<AudioContext> { }
public class MatchRoot : Root<MatchContext> { }
```

```csharp
// ❌ One Root owning two unrelated modules. Neither can be tested, reused, or
//    unloaded on its own.
public class GameRoot : Root<EverythingContext> { }
```

### A Mediator wires; it does not decide

```csharp
// ✅ The mediator turns a view callback into a signal and renders what it is told.
public void OnRegister()
{
    _signals.Outgoing.CurrencyChanged.AddListener(Render);
    _view.SpendClicked += () => _signals.Incoming.SpendCurrency.Dispatch();
}
```

```csharp
// ❌ The spending rule now lives in the presentation layer, where no command chain
//    and no console line will ever show it.
private void OnSpendClicked()
{
    if (_playerModel.Currency < _price) { _view.ShowError(); return; }
    _playerModel.Spend(_price);
}
```

---

## Pitfalls

### Injected property is null

Three causes, in order of likelihood:

1. It is a **field**, not a property. `[Inject]` only applies to properties.
2. The type was never bound, or was bound in a different Context with the plain
   `InjectionBinder` while you inject from another Context.
3. You are reading it in a constructor. Move the work to `PostConstruct()` and
   implement `IConstructable`.

### A signal fires but nothing happens

Check whether the signal instance you dispatched is the one you bound. Two contexts
each calling `InjectionBinderCrossContext.Bind<FooSignals>()` get the *same*
instance — that is the point — but a context that used `InjectionBinder.Bind<FooSignals>()`
gets its own, and the two never meet.

The same goes for a Connector that reached for `Bind` instead of `GetInstance`. If the
module that owns the holder is not in the scene, `Bind` gives the Connector a holder of its
own and every connection it makes is to a signal nobody dispatches.

The Flow Console's `Signal` channel shows every dispatch. If the dispatch appears and
no command follows, the binding is the problem.

### `Setup()` runs but the other module's signals are empty

`Setup()` runs after all Roots have bound — but only Roots that were in the scene at
that moment. A module loaded later by an additive scene load gets its own
`StartContexts()` pass; wire it from its own Connector rather than assuming it was
present at boot.

### Listener still fires after the view is gone

A Mediator subscribed in `OnRegister` and did not unsubscribe in `OnRemove`.
Mediators are pooled, so the stale subscription comes back attached to the next view
that uses that mediator type.

### A sub-context never runs

Sub-contexts are attached in the Root's inspector, not in code. If you renamed or
moved the Context class, the stored `ContextFullName` no longer resolves and the
console logs `Context Type couldn't find!`. Re-add it from the inspector, or run
*Tools ▸ FlowIoC ▸ Module Scanner*.

### A second copy of an app-wide module appears

A Root that calls `DontDestroyOnLoad` itself is never deduplicated: every load of its
scene builds one more copy, each with its own Context, each binding the same types
across (`There is a same injection!`) and registering under the same name. Mark the
Root `[PersistentRoot]` instead, and the copy a reload brings stands down.
