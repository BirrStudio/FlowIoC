# Loading

## Purpose
Shows, waits for and times the game's loading, and does none of the loading itself: steps are
declared in `CD_LoadingSets`, grouped into sets with a presentation, the Command doing the work
reports its step by name, and a set ends when every step it lists has completed, skipped or failed.

## Concepts
loading, progress bar, boot, splash, set, step, preload, stall, retry, spinner, waiting,
ILoadingService, ILoadingStep, CD_LoadingSets, LoadingSetStatusRVO, ILoadingService.Commands.Begin,
ILoadingService.Commands.Await, LoadingSpinner

## Decisions
- **A reporting Command names only its step.** Which set the step belongs to - and so whether the
  boot waits for it - is `CD_LoadingSets`'s decision, so the critical path is tuned by editing the
  asset and no Command changes. A step in no set is an error at the Command; a step in two sets is
  an error at the asset.
- **The service offers no "is X loaded" query.** A readiness registry would let one module depend
  on another's load without a Connector, which is the crossing the rules forbid in disguise. Every
  module knows its own readiness and announces it; the service shows, waits for its own sets, and
  times.
- **The service injects no other service.** Loading through `IPoolService` or `IScreenService`
  here would mean knowing the game's group names and labels - Connector-shaped knowledge - and the
  module would become the one everything depends on. The Command that does the work reports.
- **A set completes itself** when every configured step has ended; a chain waits at
  `ILoadingService.Commands.Await`. Nobody counts and nobody declares it done. A running set that hears
  nothing for its `StallWarningSeconds` is reported once, naming the steps it waits for - the
  silent hang both reference projects had. The report is a warning, not an error: the watch
  cannot tell a hang from slow work that reports nothing - a backend call with no progress - and a
  step with a deadline of its own reports Fail, which the loading screen answers with a retry.
- **A set the module lets go of ends with it.** `LoadingModel.Deconstruct` - the context going, or
  `Load` reading the asset again - ends a running set Failed, unannounced, and answers whoever still
  awaits a set with `false`. The stall watch runs on the `CoroutineProvider`, which is
  `DontDestroyOnLoad`, and stops only when its set ends: left running, a set torn down with its scene
  kept the watch polling until Play ended and warning that it had heard nothing, and a chain at
  `ILoadingService.Commands.Await` waiting for ever. A call that still arrives afterwards - a step
  whose work outlived its own module - is ignored and said once, as a warning, rather than an
  error per report that blames the config.
- **Only a Fullscreen set announces that it began.** `FullscreenBegan` lets the Connector open the
  loading screen without an `if`; `SetChanged`, `SetCompleted` and `SetFailed` reach it for every
  set and its Mediator applies only the set it is showing.
- **A screen that waits for its own data shows a spinner inside itself, not a screen over it.**
  `Prefabs/LoadingSpinner` goes into the screen's prefab - a game changes the icon, the size or the
  speed in a variant of it - and the screen's View switches it on before each opening and off when
  it is filled. A screen over the panel blocked its close button until the data came; inside, the
  player may leave without waiting. The service is not involved: the screen's own module knows when
  its data is in. A wait that must block everything is a screen of the game's own with the spinner
  inside. Overlay was a presentation until 2026-10-05; its enum value 2 is not reused.
- **The spinner carries a Canvas of its own.** It turns every frame, and a turning element rebuilds
  the canvas it sits on; nested, it rebuilds only itself and not the screen around it.
- **A failed set reopens** when its failed step reports again, keeping the steps that succeeded;
  `Begin` on it is a fresh run. The shipped retry re-runs the whole boot chain.
- **The four Commands are synchronous.** Every command in a group receives the dispatch's
  `[SignalParam]`, so the set key travels on `SetTouched` rather than through `Release(...)`, and
  each Command is unit-tested by calling `Execute()`.
- **The loading screen carries a tag, `LoadingConstants.SCREEN_TAG`, published in Shared.** A
  loading screen cannot show its own load, so the boot loads the tag into the pool as its first
  step - `.ToSequence<IScreenService.Commands.LoadByTag>(LoadingConstants.SCREEN_TAG)` - before the set it
  shows begins; `Begin` then opens the screen from the pool, on stage the same frame, and every
  load after it is drawn on the bar. The constant is here rather than in `MainConstants` because
  the screen contexts read it too and a screen module reaches only its parent's Shared. It is
  `ScreenTag.GroupA`; a game whose GroupA is taken moves it once, here.

## Known gaps
- Messages are shown as written; localisation is the game's, before it reports.
- Warnings go where `FlowLogger` sends them, so with `SendLogsToUnityConsole` off they are in the
  Flow Console only; errors reach both.
