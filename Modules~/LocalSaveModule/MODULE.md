# LocalSaveModule

## Purpose
Writes the ScriptableObjects filed on its Root to a file of the module's own and reads them back
before any other module wakes up.

## Concepts
save, load, local storage, persistence, save file, .flowsave, encryption, password,
ILocalSaveService, LocalSaveRootAdapter

## Decisions
- **Own store, no vendor.** The first version sat on Easy Save 3 and used six of its calls - a
  key-to-string map in cache mode, flushed on demand. That was the whole dependency, and it cost a
  paid asset that kept the module out of the public package, a setup step that failed as a missing
  type when skipped (`Tools/Easy Save 3/Enable Assembly Definition Files`), and an `ES3Defaults`
  asset that rewrote itself every time an assembly came or went. `LocalSaveFile` is the map on
  disk now: one JSON object, one member per asset, written to a `.tmp` and moved over the old file
  the way ES3 did, so a kill mid-write leaves the previous save whole.
- **Newtonsoft, narrowed to Unity's rules.** JsonUtility could not carry a Dictionary member, so
  a game that keeps progress in one had to flatten it. Newtonsoft does the serializing and
  `UnityFieldContractResolver` keeps it to what Unity would have saved: public fields and
  `[SerializeField]` ones, no properties, no references to other Objects. `LocalSaveTypeBinder`
  refuses to build a type from outside the project's own assemblies, because a save file sits in
  the player's folder and can be edited. `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` is a dependency of the
  core package for this.
- **`.flowsave`, not `.json`.** The owner did not want a file that invites the player to open it
  in whatever their system pairs with `.json` and change a number. `SaveFile.flowsave` under
  `Application.persistentDataPath`; the contents are JSON all the same, so a developer reads it.
- **Encryption is one field.** `Password` on `LocalSaveRootAdapter`, empty by default. Set, the
  file is AES-256-CBC with a PBKDF2 key over a fresh salt and IV, behind a `FLOWSAVE` header. It
  keeps a player from editing the file in a text editor, not from a determined one: the password is
  a string in the build, and the Help page says so. Reading goes by the file, not the setting - a
  plain file is read whatever the password says and the next `Flush` writes it encrypted, so a game
  that turns encryption on later keeps every save it has. An encrypted file with no password, or
  the wrong one, is an error and an empty session.
- **The session is opened once.** `BeginSession(password)` reads the file into memory in the
  model's `PostConstruct`; `Has`, `LoadInto` and `Save` work on that copy, and nothing reaches disk
  until `Flush`. The two steps a game binds, `ILocalSaveService.Commands.Save` and `.SaveAll`,
  flush at the end; the Context saves everything on pause and the Root on quit, because a
  backgrounded mobile app is often killed without quitting.
- **A panel, under `Tools/FlowIoC-Modules/Local Save/Panel`.** The developer's view of the file on this
  machine: path and state, its contents read with the password off the `LocalSaveServiceRoot` in the open
  scene or one typed, *Reset* (the file and a stray `.tmp`), *Clear PlayerPrefs*, and *Rewrite* under
  another password for the day the Root's changes. It reads and never edits - the file is the
  Model's - and its buttons are off in play mode, where the game holds the save in memory. The
  window is FlowIoC's (`ModulePanel` drawn by `ModulePanelWindow`); the module ships only
  `LocalSavePanel` and its `[MenuItem]`, under `Scripts/Editor` in `#if UNITY_EDITOR`, which is why
  the asmdef references `FlowIoC.Editor` - a reference Unity drops for a player build. The owner
  put the root beside `Tools/FlowIoC` rather than inside it (2026-09-15): a module adds nothing to
  FlowIoC's own menu, and `FlowIoC-Modules` sits second under Tools, ahead of `FlowIoC-dev`.
- **An Editor run starts from the asset's file.** The model snapshots every filed asset in
  `PostConstruct`, puts the snapshot back at once, reads the save over it, and puts it back again
  on quit - so play leaves no diff on the asset. The snapshot comes from the file rather than from
  memory: a run whose restore never happened (stopped mid-boot, or Play pressed while the last
  run was still exiting) left the save's values in memory, not dirty, and every later run used to
  capture them as its baseline - a reset save then still opened on the old level. An asset with an
  unsaved inspector edit is snapshotted from memory, because that edit is the developer's.
- **A reset puts back what the module captured, not an authored copy.** `ResetAll` exists for a
  delete-account button: the game resets everything filed here and reloads its scene. Once the
  load has run a build holds an asset's shipped values nowhere, so the model captures each one in
  `PostConstruct` - after the Editor's restore, before the load - through the save's own
  serializer (`AssetStartingValues`), and a reset populates the asset back from it, empties the
  session and writes every asset. An `SD_X_Reset` copy per asset was the other shape and was
  turned down (2026-10-26): it drifts from the `SD_` whenever a field or a default changes. The
  Editor's snapshot stays a mechanism of its own - it reads the asset's file with Unity's whole
  serialization and is there for a clean asset after play, not for a reset that has to behave the
  same in a build.
- **Errors through `Debug.LogError`.** A save that silently does nothing looks exactly like success
  until the player restarts, so the failure has to reach a release build's log.

## Known gaps
- No save slots and no versioning of the file: one file per game, and a field that changes type
  between builds is read as far as Newtonsoft can take it.
- The `.tmp` write is only as atomic as the platform's move; there is no checksum.
