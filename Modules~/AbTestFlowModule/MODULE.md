# AbTestFlow

## Purpose
Puts a player into one group of the active A/B test once, writes that group's config assets over
the game's own before any other module reads them, and publishes where the player stands.

## Concepts
ab test, a/b test, split test, experiment, variant, control group, rollout, bucketing, override,
IAbTestFlowService, CD_AbTests, RD_AbTestStatus, AbTestStatusRVO, AbTestId, TestUserPercent, matrix

## Decisions
- **The service starts the module, a Command sequence decides.** `AbTestFlowService.PostConstruct`
  dispatches `ResolveAbTests`, and `ReadStoredAbTestsCommand`, `ProcessAbTestCommand` and
  `ApplyOverridesCommand` do the work. It is PostConstruct rather than Setup because PostConstruct
  runs during the binding pass: a Root at `-90` has changed every config asset before any game
  module's own PostConstruct reads it, and Setup would be a frame too late.
- **The model is data.** It reads `CD_AbTests` and `RD_AbTestStatus` off the Root's adapter and
  files what the commands decide; it rolls nothing. It is bound locally, and only the service is
  bound cross-context - the module's single counterpart, and what the Root asks on quit to put the
  Editor's assets back.
- **No sub services.** Nobody outside calls the module's inner work, so there is no surface to
  group; the dice, PlayerPrefs and the copy sit in the three commands.
- **Nothing is announced.** The decision is made at boot, before any other module is listening, so
  an Outgoing signal would reach nobody. Where the player stands is `RD_AbTestStatus` in Shared,
  filed in the Root's Shared Scriptables and read through `ISharedDataModel` by whoever wants it
  when they are ready, and the deciding commands log it in words.
- **Storage.** PlayerPrefs at `flowioc.abtest.<AbTestId>` as `"<version>|<group>"`, `-` for a
  player the rollout left out. Raising a test's `Version` is the only way to decide again, and it
  decides for everybody - a test is restarted, not amended. A stored group the config no longer has
  is decided again rather than kept.
- **One test runs at a time, named by `CD_AbTests.ActiveTestId`** (owner, 2026-09-15). There is no
  per-test switch: the asset names the active test by id, an empty name runs none, and the
  Editor panel picks it from a dropdown at the top. One at a time keeps two tests from writing
  over the same asset and keeps the result readable; a name no test carries is a validation
  error, because at boot it would run nothing without a word. Switching tests leaves the stored
  decisions alone, so a test switched back on carries on where it was.
- **The groups are a matrix, and the control column is the game's own assets** (owner, 2026-09-15).
  A group is a name and a list of assets. The first group is the control, and its list names the
  assets the test changes - the originals themselves, not copies, so nothing can drift out of
  sync. Every other group lists, at the same index, the asset that replaces each. There is no
  original/variant pair repeated per group: which assets a test touches is the test's property,
  so every column is as long as the control's and validation reports one that is not.
- **`TestUserPercent`, not `RolloutPercent`.** The share of players who enter the test at all -
  80 puts 80 of every 100 into one of the groups and leaves 20 outside - and the old name said
  nothing about which side of the split the number was (owner, 2026-09-15).
- **Variants are copied with JsonUtility**, not the Newtonsoft stack the save module uses: that
  one serialises for a file and drops every field pointing at another Object, and a variant that
  swaps a prefab or a sprite is a normal experiment. Lists are deep-copied, so an original never
  shares the variant asset's collections.
- **Two panels, because they are used at different moments** (owner, 2026-09-15): `AB Test Editor`
  while the tests are being shaped, `AB Test Selector` before pressing Play to see one variant.
- **`AB Test Editor`, under `Tools/FlowIoC-Modules/AB Test/Editor`.** The tests of every
  `CD_AbTests` in the project listed down the left - the panel window's sidebar, the active one
  marked, a `+` on the list heading - and the clicked one open on the right, remembered in
  SessionState; *Select asset* sits on the window bar. Its fields and groups are drawn from the
  asset's own `SerializedProperty`s through the panel painter's `Property` marks - undo,
  dirtying and saving are Unity's, and the panel edits what the Inspector edits, never a Model.
  The open test's heading carries *Activate* or *Deactivate* and a red `-` that deletes it with a
  confirm; `+` on the list seeds a 100% test with `control` and `variant` and opens it, without
  activating it. The groups are a matrix: the group names across the top with a green `+` and a
  red `-` at the end - the `-` off while only the two a test needs are there - a row per asset
  with a red `-` that takes the row out of every group, and *Add asset* under the rows. What a
  row means sits behind its `?`, the way a Root's inspector explains its fields, never as a note
  under it. The validator's messages carry a scope (`AbTestValidationScope`) and sit under the
  part they are about - a group message under the Groups row, a cell message under its asset row
  with the cell washed red, the no-asset warning under *Add asset*, the rest under the fields -
  and a message about an unnamed test at the asset (`AbTestAuthoringTools.Messages`). Structural
  changes are deferred to the end of the draw, because the rows are walked by index.
- **A panel, `AB Test Selector`, under `Tools/FlowIoC-Modules/AB Test/Selector`.** Every test of every `CD_AbTests` in
  the project with the group this machine's player is in, read from PlayerPrefs; *Force <group>*
  and *Force outside* write the key in the module's own `<version>|<group>` shape so the next
  boot reads a forced group as a rolled one, and *Reset* forgets it. `AbTestPrefsTools` does the
  prefs without a window so the tests reach it; `AbTestSelectorPanel` only draws. The menu entry says
  `AB Test` because a slash in a menu path opens a submenu. The asmdef references `FlowIoC.Editor`
  for the two, under `#if UNITY_EDITOR`; Unity drops the reference for a player build (owner,
  2026-09-15, opening panels to every module).
- **The Editor's assets are put back on quit.** The originals are captured before the first
  override and restored, so a play session leaves no diff on an asset nobody edited. They are
  captured from the asset's file rather than from memory - unless the asset has an unsaved
  inspector edit, which is the developer's - and put back at boot as well, so a run whose restore
  never happened cannot leave its variant in the asset for the next one to build on.

## Known gaps
- JsonUtility does not copy `[SerializeReference]` fields. Validation warns; the copy omits them.
- Decisions are local. A backend-driven test would replace the two dice in `ProcessAbTestCommand`.
- The group cannot be picked by hand in game yet - the Selector panel does it in the Editor. The
  PlayerPrefs format above is what an SRDebugger module would write; a change takes effect on the
  next launch.
- The test scene's Raise button lasts one session: `CD_AbTests` is put back on quit, so the next
  launch decides once more for a status stored under the raised version.
